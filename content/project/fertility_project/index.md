In this paper I study the labour market effects of having additional children. I find
a limited impact of going from two to three children using a novel source of exogenous
variation in family size stemming from prenatal screening information. In a regression
discontinuity design I compare women across the age 35 threshold in Danish prenatal
screening guidelines at which women where informed of their age related risk of having
a child with Downs syndrome. Women just over the threshold during the pregnancy
for their second child reduced subsequent fertility by 15% but had similar labour market
outcomes 1 to 10 years following the birth of the second child. Using twinning and the
sex-composition as instruments for fertility I find similarly small effects of the third
child. This is robust evidence of the external validity of the limited impact of fertility
at the intensive margin as the three strategies applies to different compliers.
