I'm a PhD student in the Department of Business and Economics at the university of Sourthern Denmark and employed at VIVE - The Danish Center for Social Science Research. I have a BSc and MSc in economics from the University of Sourthern Denmark. I hand in my dissertation June 2021. 

I'm an applied microeconomist with research interests at the intersection of health and labour economics. My dissertation is about the impact of health interventions on socioeconomic outcomes and the role of clinical guidelines in rationing care. I use register data and quasi experiments to find causal effects.
